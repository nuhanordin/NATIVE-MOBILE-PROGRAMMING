Activity 3: Use nullability in Kotlin

3.2 Use nullable variable
fun main() {
    var number: Int? = 10
    println(number)
    
    number = null
    println(number)
}

3.3 Handle nullable variables
fun main() {
    var favoriteActor: String? = "Sandra Oh"

    val lengthOfName = favoriteActor?.length ?: 0

    println("The number of characters in your favorite actor's name is $lengthOfName.")
}
